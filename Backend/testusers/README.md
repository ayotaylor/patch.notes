# Test Users Folder

This folder contains test user credentials generated by the test suite.

## Purpose

The test suite creates test users in the database and writes their credentials to text files in this folder so you can manually log in with those users.

## Usage

1. Run the test `Create10PermanentTestUsers_WithCredentialsFile` in `UserCreationTests.cs` to generate 10 test users
2. The credentials will be written to a file named `test_users_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`
3. Use these credentials to log in to your application

## Cleanup

- To remove the test users from the database, run `CleanupReviewTesterUsers_ForManualExecution` test
- To remove reviews created by test users, run `CleanupAllReviewTesterReviews_ForManualExecution` test

## Security Note

These are test credentials only. This folder is gitignored to prevent accidentally committing sensitive information.
